## Admin Panel Overview

The admin panel allows administrators to manage user requests effectively. Key features include:

- **User Authentication:** Secure login for administrators with the default username `Boss007` and password `pass`.
- **Ticket Management:** View, filter, and update the status of user-submitted tickets.
  - **Filters:** Administrators can filter tickets by status (`pending`, `in-progress`, `completed`) and submission date.
  - **Pagination:** The admin panel supports pagination to manage large numbers of tickets, with options to show 5, 10, or 20 tickets per page.
- **Status Updates:** Administrators can update the status of user requests directly from the admin panel, helping keep track of progress.
- **Request Details:** For longer user requests, a "See More" button reveals the full content without cluttering the interface.
- **Deletion of Tickets:** Administrators can delete tickets if necessary, helping maintain a clean and organized database.

### How to Use the Admin Panel

1. **Login:**
   - Navigate to the login page and use the default credentials (`Boss007` / `pass`) to access the admin dashboard.
   - Upon successful login, administrators are redirected to the user tickets management page.

2. **Managing Tickets:**
   - Use the filters and pagination controls to navigate through the tickets.
   - Update the status of a ticket by selecting the appropriate status from the dropdown menu.
   - View full request details by clicking the "See More" button, which opens a modal with the complete message.
   - To delete a ticket, click the "Delete" button next to the ticket.

## SQL Back-end Overview

### Database Structure

The SQL back-end is built using MariaDB and manages two primary tables:

1. **`tickets`** - This table stores user requests with the following structure:
    - `id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each request.
    - `name`: Name of the user.
    - `phone`: User's phone number.
    - `email`: User's email address.
    - `request`: The message or service request made by the user.
    - `status`: The current status of the request (`pending`, `in-progress`, `completed`).
    - `submission_date`: The date when the request was submitted.

2. **`users`** - This table stores user credentials, specifically for admin access:
    - `id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each user.
    - `username`: The username for the user (default admin is `Boss007`).
    - `password_hash`: The hashed password for secure authentication (default password is `pass`).

### How to Use the Database

1. **Setting Up the Database:**
   - Import the provided SQL dump into your MariaDB or MySQL instance to create the necessary tables and initial data.
   - Ensure that the `tickets` table is configured to auto-increment the `id` field to prevent conflicts when inserting new records.

2. **Admin Access:**
   - The default admin username is `Boss007`, and the password is `pass`.
   - The password is stored as a hashed value in the `users` table, ensuring security. For hashing passwords, ensure your PHP environment uses a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., `password_hash()` function).

3. **Storing User Information:**
   - User requests submitted through the contact form on the front-end are stored in the `tickets` table.
   - The admin can view and manage these requests, updating the status as needed.

### Notes for Contributors

- **Security:** Contributions should prioritize security, especially when handling user data and authentication processes.
- **Database Migrations:** If you make changes to the database schema, please include migration scripts and update the SQL dump accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP & MySQL:** For backend processing and database management.
- **HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS:** For creating a clean, modern, and responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Enhancing user interaction and handling form submissions.

## Author's Message to Contributors

Hey everyone,

I know this is a really basic webpage right now, but I'm passionate about turning it into a fully functional business. While there may be some security issues at this stage, I'm committed to fixing them and I'm actively looking for a positive team of contributors who can help build a secure and professional website. The goal is to manage user requests and, in the future, potentially handle transactions and employee management.

For now, I'm focused on creating a working business while I continue my computer science studies. This project is also a way for me to earn some money to help cover my expenses, like gas.

Looking forward to collaborating with you all!
